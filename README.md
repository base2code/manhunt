# ManHunt

[SpigotMC page](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/manhunt.90409/)

## Minecraft Manhunt
_It was originally a plugin developed in about 30 mins to play with my friends!_

The speed runner has to find 3 golden blocks placed randomly in a 250 block radius.

## Mechanics:
1. If the speed runner dies the hunters win.
2. If the speed runner finds all golden blocks he wins.
3. If a hunter dies he will respawn and get a new compass.

_The speed runner has a compass which points to the golden block. The Hunters have a compass pointing towards the speed runner._

## How to start the game:
1. The Admin types "/init" to place 3 golden blocks randomly in the world.
2. All players are giving themselves a role:
- speed runner - ONLY 1 PLAYER - /speedrunner
- hunter - /hunter
3. The admin starts the game with /start
- A 20 sec cool down starts and the speed runner can run away
- The hunters are unable to move

## Installation:
Place the plugin in the "plugins" directory

_No plugin directory is created by the plugin!_
